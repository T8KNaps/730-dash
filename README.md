# 730Dash

*730Dash* is a Python project I (Jordan Lindsey) am creating as a personal contribution to [730DC](https://www.730dc.com/), a Washington, D.C.-based local newsletter. The project scrapes the newsletter, (and will access the newsletter's backend API) to create data insights for the 730DC team. The project will culminate in a dashboard for the 730DC team to use.
